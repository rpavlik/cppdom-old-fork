Dependencies
============
- Reasonably compliant C++ compiler (gcc 3.x, vc 7.1, etc)
- Boost library: See www.boost.org for details and downloads
- CppUnit (optional for test suite): See cppunit.sf.net
- SConsAddons - Addon library for the build system.  https://realityforge.vrsource.org/SconsAddons

Building on Windows
===================
Open the file vc7\cppdom.sln using Visual Studio (version 2002 or newer
is required).  Build the desired targets (usually "Debug - DLL" and
"Release - DLL").  The compiled files will be in the 'lib' subdirectory of
the source tree.

Installation must be performed by hand.  The following commands show a
possible way to install everything correctly:

   mkdir C:\cppdom\include\cppdom
   mkdir C:\cppdom\lib
   copy cppdom\*.h C:\cppdom\include\cppdom
   copy lib\*.lib C:\cppdom\lib
   copy lib\*.dll C:\cppdom\lib

NOTE: Compiling the OPTIONAL Spirit-based parser (see cppdom\SpiritParser.cpp)
is not currently supported by the Visual Studio solution vc7\cppdom.sln.

Building
========
CppDom uses the scons build system.  You can download scons from www.scons.org.

We also use the SconsAddons library (see above).  You will need it's source 
directory in your PYTHONPATH to build.

ex: https://realityforge.vrsource.org/svn/scons-addons/trunk/scons-addons

PYTHONPATH=/home/username/scons-addons/src

NOTE: In the future we hope to use 3rd party branches or svn:externals to 
remove the need to download this separately.

Once you have both of these, the follow steps should be all you need.

Please see 'scons --help' for a list of options for specifying where the
dependencies are located.

type 'scons' to build cppdom shared lib.
type 'scons install' to install on the system
type 'scons install prefix=$HOME/software' to install in your account
